## ðŸ§© Modular Build Logic

Before contributing any new features, please review our [Modular Build Logic documentation](../docs/MODULAR_BUILD_LOGIC.md).

### Key Requirements:
- âœ… Each module must be isolated, swappable, and updatable on its own
- âœ… All modules must follow the same folder + route naming structure  
- âœ… Shared elements go in a central library (e.g. buttons, loaders, modals)
- âœ… Any new module must be tested for layout, speed, error handling, and scaling

### Before Submitting a PR:
1. Verify your module follows the established structure
2. Test for responsiveness and performance
3. Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality
4. Update documentation if introducing new patterns

## Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Follow the modular build logic principles
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with detailed description
5. Request review from maintainers
